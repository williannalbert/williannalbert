# Hi everyone, i'm Willian Nalbert
<p width="45%">
Hi, nice to meet you. Let me introduce my profile in a few lines.
  <ul>
    <li>👨‍🔧 I'm an <b>.Net Dev</b></li>
    <li>📍 I'm from <b>São Paulo</b></li>
    <li>🌱 I'm currently learning <b>.Net APIs</b> and <b>Angular</b></li>
    <li>💬 You can ask me about <b>Selenium, Laravel, .Net</b></li>
  </ul>
I am a .NET developer specializing in process automation using Selenium. With experience in creating and maintaining automated solutions, I have been helping companies optimize their workflows, reduce human errors, and increase operational efficiency.
<br>I worked for one year developing applications in Laravel, and for the past two and a half years, I have been focused on automation using Selenium. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in developing web applications with .NET API and Angular, always striving to evolve and expand my skills in the field of programming.
